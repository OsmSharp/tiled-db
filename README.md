# tiled-osm-db

Try to complete a full implementation (implementing a full single db IHistoryDb is not possible).

Done:
- Built a tile splitter, splits one file in a folder.

We need:
- Build a TileDbBuilder that builds a TileDb from the split tiles.

Directory Structure:

- One directory per changeset '{changesetid}' and one based directory called 'base'
